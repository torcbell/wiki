# Theme overrides

This folder contains draft theme overrides for the core wiki client styles.
Each theme is a lightweight stylesheet that is designed to be layered on top
of the base `style.css` from `client/style`.

## How to use

1. Load the base stylesheet first:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/client/style/style.css" />
   ```

2. Load one of the theme overrides after the base stylesheet:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/client/style/themes/sunrise.css" />
   ```

The override files only adjust colors, backgrounds, and accents for the main UI
components (body, page cards, headers/footers, buttons, and selection states).
They intentionally keep layout, spacing, and typography from `style.css` intact.

## Available drafts

- `sunrise.css`
- `dusk.css`
- `ocean.css`
- `forest.css`
- `slate.css`
- `aurora.css`
